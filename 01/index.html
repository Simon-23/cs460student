      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a interactive musical film by Chris Milk based on the song called 3 Dreams of black
      by Danger Mouse, Daniele Luppi & Norah Jones. RO.ME was created in 2011 using WebGL where users
      were able to steer themselves throughout the narrative. This was huge at that time since WebGL
      and html 5 enabled devlopers to create realistic interactive 2D & 3D graphical models on the web by using 
      your computers video card which was never possible before. By creating something like RO.ME, it shows that 
      you can have more than just standard images and videos on the web. It opens up the opportunity and possibilies 
      to have real time dynamic graphics rendering while you experience the film.

      Technology: <!-- TODO: FILL IN THE TECHNOLOGIES USED -->
      In this film, 2D and 3D graphics were
      implemented along with video, audio, and multimedia all combined together to create this film through WebGL. Majority
      of the film was created not using video but rather a real time rendering of the graphical models
      through WebGL, html 5, and javascript. WebGL is hardware accelerated which means it
      uses your videocard to render the graphical models really fast. This is what allows users to interact with 
      the film in real time very smoothly.
